  <h1>About Manabind</h1>

  <div class="card-section textbox">
    <h2>The Beginning</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Valentin, born and raised in Vienna, Austria. I've always had a deep fascination with cards—starting with Pokémon as a kid and later falling in love with Yu-Gi-Oh, both the game and the anime. Cards felt alive to me, each with its own soul—probably because I watched too many shows that made them seem that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, I even learned card tricks, and simply holding cards in my hands has always brought me joy. In November 2024, between two jobs, the idea for Manabind was born.

    <h2>The Creative Process</h2>
    <p>
      I had a flood of ideas, but I lacked the ability to draw or design visuals myself. That’s where AI came in. I want to be open about this—yes, the base design of the cards is AI-generated, but the mechanics, names, effects, and worldbuilding all come from me.
    </p>

    <h2>The Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      Manabind is meant to be more than just another trading card game. Too often, great decks are locked behind high prices. My goal is to make the base version of every card available and affordable: no essential card should be rarer than one-per-booster, keeping the price of full decks ideally below €100. If that balance ever shifts, I plan to use emergency reprints in future sets.

    <h2>For Collectors</h2>
    <p>
      For collectors, there will also be stunning alternate-art versions in higher rarities—featuring beautiful artwork created by real artists to breathe new life into the cards.
    </p>

    <h2>The Vision</h2>
    <p>
      The vision is to release two new starter decks with each booster set, introducing new leaders and strategies. My current plan is to release new sets three times per year—though time will tell.
